In the Scarlet Editor, you can place props such as walls, floor tiles, roofs, windows, and balconies, and place entities like enemies and power-ups in Object View Mode, and then paint collision data in Collision View Mode.

Collision types:
Orange - solid collision
Gray - semi-solid, can jump through the bottom and land ontop
Red - Spikes, causes damage to the player and bounces them upwards
Dark red/maroon - Spikes as well, but this time its insta-death

Adjust the map boundaries to fit your map. This affects how vertically stretched the background textures are when rendered, and also creates a kill zone if the player falls through the bottom of the boundaries.
